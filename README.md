This is a set of code samples, still under development, aiming at teaching Django to dynamically generate and register models patterned after an initial model structure. Once generated, the DB tables can be re-discovered, and the objects saved persist.

TODO: explain it better, I suppose. Currently this repository is mostly a backup of ongoing work in progress.
